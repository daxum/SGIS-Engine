# SGIS-Engine
The engine for SGIS - an in-progress game engine that supports both OpenGL and Vulkan.

# Building

These instructions (and the program in general, actually) have only been tested on Linux (however, the code itself should be completely portable):

1. First, make sure that the following are installed:
	* [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org)
	* [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net)
	* [bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) (Must be built with tbb multithreading enabled)
	* [Freetype2](https://www.freetype.org/)
	* [TBB](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/)

2. Assuming everything is installed correctly, you can then do `./buildEngine --setup` to setup cmake, and then `cd build` followed by `make -j$(nproc)` to build the engine.

	There are also options to build and link glfw and bullet along with the engine, build the engine test programs, and disable OpenGL and/or Vulkan support (though doing both is rather pointless). All of these are explained at the top of the buildEngine script.

	Finally, there are three variables at the top of the script that point to the tbb and freetype2 include/library directories - these might need to be changed to match the path on your system.

The file `stb_image.h` was obtained from [here](https://github.com/nothings/stb), and makes a mess of the language indexing on github :(.

The file `tiny_obj_loader.h` was obtained from [here](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader).

The file `vk_mem_alloc.h` was obtained from [here](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator).

The files `gl_core_4_1.h` and `gl_core_4_1.c` were automatically generated by [glLoadGen](https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/glloadgen/wiki/Home), and then slightly modified to suppress warnings.
