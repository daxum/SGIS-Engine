# SGIS-Engine
The engine for SGIS

# Building

These instructions (and the program in general, actually) have only been tested on Linux:

1. First, make sure that the following are installed, or modify CMakeLists.txt to use local copies (replace `find_package()` with `add_subdirectory()`)
	* [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org)
	* [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net)
2. From the top of the repository, do:

	`cd src`

	`cmake .`

	`make`

	or, to build out of tree:

	`mkdir build`

	`cd build`

	`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ../src`

	`make`

	This will create a file called libEngine.a, which can be linked with other projects.

The file `stb_image.h` was obtained from [here](https://github.com/nothings/stb), and makes a mess of the language indexing on github :(.
The file `tiny_obj_loader.h` was obtained from [here](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader).

The files `gl_core_4_1.h` and `gl_core_4_1.c` were automatically generated by [glLoadGen](https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/glloadgen/wiki/Home), and then slightly modified to suppress warnings.
